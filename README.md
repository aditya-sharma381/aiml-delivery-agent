# aiml-delivery-agent
This project involves designing and implementing an autonomous delivery agent that navigates a 2D grid. The agent will use uninformed (BFS/Uniform-Cost), informed (A*), and local search algorithms to find efficient paths for package delivery, handling static and dynamic obstacles. The project requires a report, a demo, and code submitted via Git.
